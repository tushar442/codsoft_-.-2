**Project Title:** Iris Classification

**Overview:**
The goal of this project was to classify different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements. Using the famous Iris dataset, I built a machine learning model using logistic regression to accurately classify the species of a flower based on its features.

**Objectives:**
- To analyze and preprocess the Iris dataset.
- To build a machine learning model to classify iris species.
- To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and accuracy.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Used **Pandas** for initial data exploration and analysis.
   - Visualized feature relationships using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to understand the distribution of different species based on sepal and petal measurements.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Checked for missing values and ensured data consistency.
   - Standardized feature scaling to improve model accuracy.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** to classify the iris species.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the logistic regression model using accuracy.
   - Visualized the classification results with confusion matrix plots and performance metrics.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression (from Scikit-learn)

**Outcome:**
The logistic regression model achieved high accuracy in classifying iris species, reinforcing my understanding of classification techniques and data visualization. This project also strengthened my ability to work with machine learning models and data preprocessing.
